# Purpose of App
This app is for users to keep track of different coding events. 
Users can view all events and by clicking on each event they will be able to view the details of that event.
Users can create an event by including the name, contact email, and event type, and optional is a description. 
Events can be deleted and view by filtering by event type(category).
Events can also have tags added to them and a user can create new tags as needed.
All events are stored and saved in tables in MySQLWorkbench
